# Project for tomorrow

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

During the quarantine, many people started looking for hobbies they could try at home by only gaining knowledge on the internet and getting the required tools and materials in their local markets or online. However, sometimes it can be intimidating to look for needed materials or tools while not being very familiar with them. "Project for tomorrow" would help people start the project with ease. After typing the project's name, the program would find the needed products (with stores, prices, and ratings), tutorials, and the hardness level.

## Background

It is always hard to start something new. It applies to everything from changing a workplace to moving to another neighborhood or starting a new craft. This project would help people try out a new thing without worries and with less anxiety or self-doubt. Nowadays, young people are trying many new things, from crocheting, and cooking, to house renovation and decoration. The world is open for us to explore and create, but to do so, you need knowledge. The Internet is a great place to learn. However, it can be hard to find the right and trustworthy information. Also, it's hard to purchase the right amount of materials or not to overspend on tools for (maybe) a one-time project. These problems can stop creative people from broadening their horizons by gaining new skills. On the other hand, if they saw that the project was quite simple and not as expensive as they thought, it would push them to try it out. 
When I started crocheting, I couldn't help but overspend on the yarn because I wasn't familiar with the amount I might need to complete the project. Also, there are many tutorials for crocheting clothes or amigurumi, but it takes much time and energy to find the right source. 
Another project I was willing to start was fixing my broken sofa. I am a girl, so entering a construction supplies store can be intimidating too.
To summarise, this project would help people of different gender or age to find new hobbies with more confidence and ease.

## How is it used?

The use would be simple enough. The willing to start a new project person would type the name of the project of interest in the search bar. After all the suggestions pop out, the user can filter them by choosing certain things. It can be the hardness level, the project's specification (whether you want to crochet a toy or a piece of clothing, a cardigan or a sweater, out of wool or cotton), sorting them by the needed amount of money, popularity, ratings, etc. After picking the particular type of project the person wants to start, the program moves further. Different sections can be chosen (tools, materials, shops, tutorials, reviews, etc.). The use would be easy because everything will be in the same place. 
The program would be available at any time of the day, and to use it, the person will only need a computer or a phone with internet access. 

## Data sources and AI methods

The program and app or site would have to be done by professionals. However, the data would come from tools or materials sellers and purchasers (they would review, rate, set prices, give advice or recommend needed things for beginners or experienced crafters). Furthermore, more experienced crafters, who would be willing to share their skills, could upload tutorials for new types of crafts. 

## Challenges

It can be hard to ensure that uploaded information is appropriate and helpful or that reviews aren't fake. The only choice left is either: 
  1. To find a person who would look over the uploaded information;
  2. To create a program that would filter the suitable information out
  3. Let people report the inappropriate information
  4. Submit a test for people who are willing to be the creators (in this case, only they could upload the new content)

## What next?

After some time, the site or app with this program may become well known, and maybe it could offer group lessons for a specific craft. Moreover, after some time, it might be possible to open a few workshops with a variety of materials in them. Anybody could access them with a certain fee. For this to happen, what is going to be needed is properties. People who would teach others could welcome enthusiasts in their workshops and teach beginners there.

## Acknowledgments

AI courses pushed me towards letting my creativity flow, so thanks to them.
